That guide is mainly for beginners.

To add a new tag you need:
  - Open "tags.ts" file
  - Open "accountUtils.ts" file
  - Open "adminIntarfaces.ts" file
  - Open "colors.ts" file
  - Open "_custom.scss" file
  - Open "_variables.scss" file
  - Open "pony-box.scss" file

The "(!!!)" and "-->" sign indicates something that definitely needs to be added.
